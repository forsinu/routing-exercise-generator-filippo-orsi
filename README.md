A Python program that creates a random network with configurable properties, then runs a schematized routing algorithm on it and prints out the final routing table, plus all the exchange of messages that was required to make the routing table converge. 

Right now simple distance vector routing is supported, and line/2dgrid/Erdos graphs can be generated. 

The results are printed in a pdf file with the image of the network and the sequence of events.
